Installation
------------

First, install git if it isn't already installed.

```text
    sudo apt-get install git
```

Then, clone the repository into your home directory.

_**Note:** This script assumes that the config scripts are installed in your
home directory._

```text
    cd
    git clone https://peculiar.arndt.ca/darndt/config.git
```

Finally, run the installation script.

```text
    ./config/install.sh
```

That is all.
